age = 19

# so if age given is bigger than or equal to 18, perform the print.
if age >= 18:
    print("You are old enough to vote!")
else:
    print("Sorry, you are too young to vote")

# indentation plays the same role here as in loops.

# you can add more complexity to the statement, basically saying that if one statement is not true, go with the other one:
# this is done by adding elif and else statements
