# You can also test to see if two numbers are not equal. For example, the
# following code prints a message if the given answer is not correct:

answer = 17
#so if answer is not equal to 42 then the print function will be executed
if answer != 42:
    print("That is not hte correct answer.")

#it is good to note that you can check for multiple conditions with the and / or expressions instead of checking one condition at a time:

#the and expression checks to see whether both conditions are true and then the output will be true as well:
#but with the and , if the first condition is not true, it won't even read the second one and the output will be false!!

#the or expression only checks to see whether one of the conditions you are looking for is true, and if so then the output will be true
